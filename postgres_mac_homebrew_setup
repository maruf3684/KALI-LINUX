After Homebrew Install, Set user to Postgres

->brew services start postgresql@16

->brew services restart postgresql@16


login to shell:
-> psql postgres
-> \l :show all database
-> \du :show list of user postgres
-> \q :exit pg shell

you can login by this when you know default postgres username:
-> psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U maruf -d postgres

change Password:
ALTER USER maruf WITH PASSWORD 'maruf15-1927@';

create new user with pass:
CREATE ROLE nobopay WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'n0b0p@y' CREATEDB;

Active password and remove trust from all user
->cd /
->cd opt
->cd homebrew
->cd var
->cd /postgres@16
-> nano pg_hba.conf

current: 
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

host    replication     all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256

then:
-> brew services restart postgresql@16
-> psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U maruf -d postgres

one liner: 
-> PGPASSWORD=maruf15-1927@ psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U maruf -d postgres
